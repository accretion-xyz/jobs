# Operations Manager - Solana Security

**Company:** Accretion Labs  
**Location:** Remote
**Type:** Full-time  

## About Accretion Labs

We're dedicated to becoming the most technically competent security firm in the Solana ecosystem. With deep expertise in SVM and Rust, we've secured over $1B in TVL across Solana's top protocols - from leading DeFi platforms and lending protocols to DAOs, infrastructure, and launchpads.

Our vision extends beyond audits. We're building the security tools that developers need, establishing standards that elevate the entire ecosystem, and creating educational resources that make Solana more secure for everyone. This is your opportunity to join a boutique firm with the ambition to become an ecosystem pillar.

## The Role

We need a business operations expert to handle all the administrative and operational work that keeps Rob away from auditing and strategy. You'll own the business infrastructure - contracts, invoicing, vendor management, and all the behind-the-scenes work that makes everything run smoothly.

Rob should be finding bugs and closing deals, not chasing invoices and managing contractors.

### Business Administration (40%)
- Invoice generation, tracking, and collections
- Contract preparation, review, and management
- Vendor and contractor management
- Financial record keeping and expense tracking
- Legal and compliance coordination

### Systems & Processes (35%)
- Implement and maintain business systems (CRM, accounting, etc.)
- Automate repetitive administrative tasks
- Create standardized templates and workflows
- Build dashboards for business metrics
- Ensure compliance with regulations and standards

### Team & Client Support (25%)
- Handle initial client onboarding and setup
- Manage contractor agreements and payments
- Coordinate team logistics and administrative needs
- Support hiring process and new employee onboarding
- Handle routine client communications

## You're Perfect If You Have

### Must-Haves
- 3+ years operations/project management experience
- Experience in fast-growing startups or consulting
- Exceptional organizational skills
- Strong written communication
- Ability to manage multiple parallel projects
- Comfort with ambiguity and rapid change

### Nice-to-Haves
